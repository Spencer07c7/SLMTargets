# SLMTargets
**SLMTargets** is a MATLAB-based GUI for running 3D _holographic_ photostimulation experiments on arbitrary sets of neurons. Its output is compromised of  phase masks used for creating custom holograms with a liquid crystal [spatial light modulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_light_modulator) (SLM) and _optional_ [Bruker](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/mr.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwj7CZBhDHARIsAPPWv3dGf_KSiU_riwNS8jdjhhcRLIdNeDB6sLp11rB1zRIoYhl91VFGrkQaAqXSEALw_wcB) microscope control files containing galvo positioning instructions and photostimulation sequencing instructions.

Cre-expressing Purkinje cells were labeled virally with the _state-of-the-art_ calcium indicator [GCaMP8s](https://www.janelia.org/jgcamp8-calcium-indicators). User-defined zones and neural clusters targeted for stimulation are colored uniquely. ]

# Basic use





**1.** Acquire a **z-stack** of your tissue of interest and load it using the **_load image_** button. The higher the z-resolution of the image stack, the more precise your holographic targeting will be. I recommend using **2-4 Âµm spacing**. Do ensure the images have a high _signal-to-noise ratio_ (you will likely need to average many images per plane).  

**2.** Run [Cellpose](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose) on the z-stack in order to automatically **extract the 3D mask** of each neuronal cell body in the form of a 'masks.tif' file. This file will be used to compute the _centroid_ of each neuron within the image volume. Load it using the **_load masks_** button.  
**Note:** The mask of each neuron contains pixels that have a value corresponding its ROI number from Cellpose. Please ensure the masks file contains as many images as your z-stack.

**3.** **Optional:** create a 'zone.tif' file in order to define zones within the **xy** plane.  

**4.** Load all files into **SLMTargets** then remove any undesirable neurons, define the stimulation cluster size, and prefered laser power per cell.  

**5.** To finish click the **_export all_** button. All target positions, phase masks, and microscope control files will be saved to the current SLMTargets directory.
