# SLMTargets
**SLMTargets** is a MATLAB-based GUI for running 3D _holographic_ photostimulation experiments on arbitrary sets of neurons. Its output consists of  phase masks for creating custom holograms with a [spatial light modulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_light_modulator) (SLM) and [Bruker](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/mr.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwj7CZBhDHARIsAPPWv3dGf_KSiU_riwNS8jdjhhcRLIdNeDB6sLp11rB1zRIoYhl91VFGrkQaAqXSEALw_wcB) microscope control files containing galvo positioning and photostimulation sequencing instructions.

Cre-expressing Purkinje cells were labeled virally with the _state-of-the-art_ calcium indicator [GCaMP8s](https://www.janelia.org/jgcamp8-calcium-indicators). User-defined zones and neural clusters targeted for stimulation are colored uniquely. ]
# Background: modulating light in space
SLMTargets enables the production of custom 3-D holograms by interfacing with a reflective _phase only_ LCoS SLM. Hence it is important to have a satisfory understanding of the physics governing hologram generation. The basic operating principle of a phase only SLM is simple: the phase of the laser light reflected off a SLM liquid crystal pixel array is dependent upon the refractive index of the pixel that it passes through. Since the refractive index of each pixel is determined by the voltage applied to it, the phase of the reflected laser wavefront can be altered in a pixelwise, spatially specific manner by uploading a phase mask to the SLM.

# Basic use
**1.** Acquire a **z-stack** of your tissue of interest and load it using the **_load image_** button. The higher the z-resolution of the image stack, the more precise your holographic targeting will be. I recommend using **2-4 Âµm spacing**. Do ensure the images have a high _signal-to-noise ratio_ (you will likely need to average many images per plane).  

**2.** Run [Cellpose](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose) on the z-stack in order to automatically **extract the 3D mask** of each neuronal cell body in the form of a 'masks.tif' file. This file will be used to compute the _centroid_ of each neuron within the image volume. Load it using the **_load masks_** button.  
**Note:** The mask of each neuron contains pixels that have a value corresponding its ROI number from Cellpose. Please ensure the masks file contains as many images as your z-stack.

**3.** **Optional:** create a 'zone.tif' file in order to define zones within the **xy** plane.  

**4.** Load all files into **SLMTargets** then remove any undesirable neurons, define the stimulation cluster size, and prefered laser power per cell.  

**5.** To finish click the **_export all_** button. All target positions, phase masks, and microscope control files will be saved to the current SLMTargets directory.
